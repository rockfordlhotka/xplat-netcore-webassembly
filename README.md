## Workshop Abstract

We have entered an era where Microsoft .NET runs everywhere, on servers and client devices. Windows, macOS, iPhone/iPad, Android, Linux, and other platforms are now supported. Perhaps even more exciting is the standards-basedÂ  WebAssembly (wasm) platform, allowing frontend web development to be done in languages other than JavaScript, including C, C++, Go, Rust, and C#. Yes, .NET now runs in the browser using native browser capabilities; no plug-ins are needed.

In this workshop Rocky and Jason will show you how to build C# and .NET code that runs on Windows, Linux, Docker, macOS, iOS, Android, and in the browser. You'll learn how to leverage .NET Core, .NET Standard (netstandard), Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Docker, and many other tools and technologies to build apps and services for each platform. Perhaps more importantly, you'll learn how to share common code across all these platforms, and techniques for when you need to also leverage platform-specific code.

Lessons:

1. Learn how to build C# and .NET code that runs cross-platform
1. Learn how to leverage .NET Standard and .NET Core
1. Learn how to share common code across platforms
